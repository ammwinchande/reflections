When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Remote acts as a backup for our work, in case you want to share your work or collaborate with other
    members / people it's easier to use remote rather than every time the person you are collaborating with
    has to copy and paste from your computer to theirs and vice-versa.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If we allow changes to be pulled automatically, it would have caused a lot of conflicts in our codes
    as while we are working git might pull the old version and replaces our new version which we haven't
    pushed it yet, while doing manual pulling helps in keeping things in sync and organised

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is like cloning but in Github only and not on local, clone is making a copy of the repository for
    your own purposes, branches is creating a new branch that is on it's own and all it's commits and push
    don't affect master branch until after being merged.
    Note: Forked repo and cloned repo changes don't affect the original repo's they've been cloned / forked from.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
