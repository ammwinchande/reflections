What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- Git creates an empty repository in a folder the command was executed,
  a directory with a name .git is created

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
- Staging area is the intermediate area in which Git gives us more control over which
  files we need to execute in a single commit, while working directory is where all our 
  files untracked, uncommitted, and committed are stored, it's a working place, and 
  repository is where we keep track of our working directory files including the different
  stages we might want to go back to incase we did something wierd.
